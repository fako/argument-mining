Split the paragraph below in one or more arguments and give them back as an Array of arguments. Represent the arguments with the following JSON:
{"premises": [premise-0", "premise-1"],  "conclusion: "conclusion"}
To do this you need to split each argument into its premises and one conclusion. Make sure that you quote the premises from the text and summarize the conclusion.

{{ text }}
